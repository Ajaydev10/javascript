// Scope of variables

// The scope of a variable defines the region of the program where it can be accessed or modified. There are generally two main types: 

// 1. Local Scope:_ Variables declared within a specific function or block of code and are only accessible within that context.
// 2:- Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block and are accessible throughout the entire program.
